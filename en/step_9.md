## Challenge: find out more

If you want to know more about the story of breaking the Enigma code, the following book will be of interest: "Dilly - The Man Who Broke Enigmas", Mavis Batey, ISBN 9781906447151, Biteback.

### Very advanced coding challenge
You could try coding the search over plug board settings. Before you start, try estimating if this is going to be achievable - even with an OctaPi cluster?
