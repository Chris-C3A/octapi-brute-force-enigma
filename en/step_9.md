## Challenge: find out more

If you want to know more about the story of breaking the Enigma code, the following book will be of interest: _Dilly - The Man Who Broke Enigmas_, Mavis Batey, ISBN 9781906447151, Biteback.

### Very advanced coding challenge
You could try coding the search over plugboard settings. Before you start, try estimating if this is going to be achievable even with an OctaPi cluster.
