## Introduction

Make and then break Enigma-encoded messages using your Raspberry Pi or [OctaPi](http://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-an-octapi){:target="_blank"}.

### What you will make

You will install [Py-enigma](http://py-enigma.readthedocs.org/){:target="_blank"} and use it to create encrypted messages (secret messages only you and those you trust can read). You will then develop Python code to do a partial brute force crypt attack on the Enigma messages and recover the machine's rotor settings.
