## Introduction

Make and then break Enigma encoded messages using your Raspberry Pi 3 or [OctaPi Raspberry Pi cluster](http://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/rpi-python-build-an-octapi).

### What you will make

You will install [Py-enigma by Brian Neal](http://py-enigmareadthedocs.org/) and use it to create encrypted messages (secret messages only you and those you trust can read). You will then develop Python code to do a partial brute force crypt attack on the Enigma messages so that you recover the machine's rotor settings.

### What you will learn

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Apply higher-order programming techniques to solve real-world problems](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/programming/maker/)
